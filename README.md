### **Phase 3: The Environment (The "Engine Room")**

Now, let's get your computer ready to code.

#### **1. Open VS Code**
Open VS Code and go to **File > Open Folder**. Select the folder you just created with GitHub Desktop.

#### **2. Create the Virtual Environment**
We don't want to install libraries globally on your PC (it gets messy). We create a "sandbox" for this project.
* In VS Code, open the Terminal (`` Ctrl + ` `` or **Terminal > New Terminal**).
* Type this command and hit Enter:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
